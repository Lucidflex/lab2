            <p>
                Hi I am Vareshan Rajah also known as Raj.
                I'm an aspiring Data Analyst, Security Analyst or
                Software Developer. I am really looking forward to 
                what this course has to offer. I'm really excited to 
                learn how to build web services and see how the frontend 
                backend work together. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm really excited to learn exactly how web services are built 
                and maintained. I really hope to learn a lot throughout this course 
                so that I could look at Software development as a potential job.
            </p>

                    My current project is to build an AI model that will
                    hopefully be able to predict the stock markets accurately.
